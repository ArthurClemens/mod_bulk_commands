# Bulk actions for Zotonic admin

Upon activation, this module will display checkboxes in admin tables, plus a "select all" / "select none" option.

Select the table rows you want to change, then press the action button. 

Actions are limited to what is visible on the page. "Select all" selects the elements on the page only.

For now only Delete has been implemented.
